# Exploratory Data Analysis and Data Science Machine Learning on Sleep Health and Lifestyle Dataset

![EDA and Machine Learning](image.jpg)

Welcome to the project repository focused on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Data Science Machine Learning on Sleep Health and Lifestyle Datasets! This project aims to showcase the power of data analysis and predictive modeling in solving real-world problems.

## About the Project

In this project, we explore Sleep Health and Lifestyle datasets and employ EDA techniques to gain insights and uncover hidden patterns in the data. Exploratory Data Analysis allows us to understand the underlying structure of the data, identify trends, detect outliers, and make data-driven decisions.

Moreover, we leverage the principles of Machine Learning to build predictive models that can make accurate predictions or classifications based on the available data. By training our models on historical data, we can deploy them to predict future outcomes, optimize processes, and make informed decisions.
